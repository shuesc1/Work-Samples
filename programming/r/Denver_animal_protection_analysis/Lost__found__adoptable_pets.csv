My name is Roxy and I am available for adoption.<p></p><p></p>I was brought in by my previous owner on August 19, 2017 because sometimes I went to the bathroom outside the litter box. <p></p><p></p>My personality color is BLUE. I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p></p><p></p>I am an affectionate lovebug who would be thrilled to cuddle up with you at home!<p></p><p></p>I was previously declawed on  all four paws. Because I can't protect myself outside, I need to be an indoor-only cat.<p></p><p></p>A veterinarian has diagnosed or tentatively diagnosed the above-described pet with the following condition(s):<p></p><p></p>1)     House soiling:  This cat has a long history of house soiling (primarily urinating).  The previous owner attempted to have this problem evaluated at a veterinarian and while the problem would resolve for periods of time, it happened repeatedly.  Based on the history, this problem is likely a behavioral problem but we recommend discussing this with your veterinarian to determine if further medical evaluation<p></p><p></p>2)  Heart murmur:  During our routine exam, a heart murmur was found.  There are currently no signs of heart disease.  In order to determine the cause of the heart murmur, a cardiac study called an echocardiogram would need to be performed.  Although many animals live normal lives with heart murmurs, it is important to discuss this with your veterinarian.<p></p><p></p>As a result of these conditions, your pet may need specialized care consisting of any or all of the below.  Please note this is not intended to be an exhaustive list.<p></p><p></p>- Special diet or prescription foods<p></p>- Prescription or over-the-counter medicines<p></p>- Regular veterinarian visits, which may include blood tests or other monitoring<p></p>- Possible surgery or other procedures as determined by your veterinarian<p></p><p></p>My caregivers have noticed that I do not seem to get along with other cats, so I may do best as the only cat in my new home. This could be why I did not always use my litterbox.<p></p><p></p><p></p> Adoption Fee: $30.00<p></p>"

My name is Loki and I am available for adoption.<p></p><p></p>I was brought in by my previous owner on April 30, 2017 because they were moving. I lived in a home with a family that had kids but due to my history of using my mouth when I am uncomfortable, my caregivers are recommending that I go to an adult only home.<p></p><p></p>I prefer the &quot;hands-off&quot; approach, meaning that I will jump on your lap and interact, but it's all on my terms. I tend to get feisty if I get too much attention....typical catitude! I am very food motivated and love snacks and toys.  If you want a cool cat, come adopt me!<p></p><p></p>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited cat with a fun-loving personality! I may be sensitive to handling, so I would do best in a home with a cat savvy family who knows when to give me some space.<p></p><p></p>A veterinarian has diagnosed or tentatively diagnosed the above-described pet with the following condition(s):<p></p><p></p>1)     This cat has a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).  He is currently being treated with oral steroids.  This condition will require long term management, which could include medications and prescription diets.  We recommend you follow up with your regular veterinarian for the best treatment plan.  An information handout is also provided.<p></p><p></p>2)   This cat has a history of struvite crystals in the urine and urinary tract infections.  He is currently being managed with a prescription diet (Hill's C/D).  This condition will most likely need longterm manament and treatment.<p></p><p></p>As a result of these conditions, your pet may need specialized care consisting of any or all of the below.  Please note this is not intended to be an exhaustive list.<p></p><p></p>- Special diet or prescription foods<p></p>- Prescription or over-the-counter medicines<p></p>- Special skin care or shampoos<p></p>- Regular veterinarian visits, which may include blood tests or other monitoring<p></p>- Possible surgery or other procedures as determined by your veterinarian<p></p><p></p> Adoption Fee: $30.00<p></p>"

I lived in a home with other cats.<p></p><p></p>My personality color is BLUE. I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p></p><p></p>I am an affectionate lovebug who would be thrilled to cuddle up with you at home!<p></p><p></p>My caregivers have noticed that I seem to do well with other cats. When meeting cats in a new home, I would do best with a slow introduction.<p></p><p></p>I was surrendered with my brother Square (A545934). We do not have to be adopted together, but it would make us happy!<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p> Adoption Fee: $30.00<p></p>"

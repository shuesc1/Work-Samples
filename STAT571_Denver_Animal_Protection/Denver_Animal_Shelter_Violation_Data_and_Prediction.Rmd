# Description of the problem
### Introduction

Denver Animal Protection is part of the City & County of Denver's organizational structure and, as such, strives to serve all members of Denver County, an area comprised of 155 square miles ([US Census Data](https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/2017_Gazetteer/2017_gaz_counties_08.txt)) and 53 unique zip codes not associated with a specific company or organization ([source](https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction!input.action), [full list](#denver-county-zip-codes)).More specifically, Denver Animal Protection (DAP) falls under the umbrella of Denver’s Department of Environmental Health (DEH), which oversees programs related to public health and environment. Within DEH there are seven different divisions (one of which is DAP): Community Health (CH), Public Health Inspection (PHI), Denver Animal Protection (DAP), the Office of Medical Examiner (OME), Environmental Quality (EQ), the Executive Director’s Office (EDO), and the Office of Sustainability (OOS) ([source](https://www.denvergov.org/content/dam/denvergov/Portals/344/documents/Budget/MayorsProposedBudget_2016.pdf)). While DAP garners much public attention, media attention generally focuses on its public facing roles of animal returns to owners and animal adoption ([1](https://www.denverpost.com/2017/11/01/denver-animal-shelter-adoption-deal/), [2](http://kdvr.com/2017/08/22/denver-animal-shelter-to-put-2-dozen-french-bulldogs-up-for-adoption-saturday/), [3](https://www.denverpost.com/2017/12/28/border-collie-deformed-front-legs-gets-cart/), [4](http://kdvr.com/2017/07/14/cat-found-in-west-denver-dumpster-finds-new-home/)). However, the shelter also offers a foster program, volunteer opportunities, a weekly vaccination clinic, pet licensing, breed evaluations, wildlife & pest control, and ordinance enforcement. Some of these services are offered at the shelter, while many others are performed by animal control officers who spend much of their time in the field. For example, in addition to enforcing Denver’s leash, pet waste, pet licensing, rabies vaccination, and spay/neuter laws, the field services unit also investigates animal bites, cruelty and neglect claims, and barking dog disturbances. One of DAP's specific strategies is to "improve public safety and animal welfare by increasing compliance with Denver’s animal codes and improving pet responsibility through proactive outreach efforts" ([Mayor’s Proposed 2017 Budget](https://www.denvergov.org/content/dam/denvergov/Portals/344/documents/Budget/2017/2017%20Budget%20Book_October%20Draft_Web%20Version.pdf), p. 603). Consequently, with more perfect knowledge of city violation trends and predictors the field services unit will be better able to target public outreach opportunities with current resources, and in turn move in the direction of greater ordinance compliance in the county. 

# Description of the data

### Data Summary

Citation data was kindly provided by the City & County of Denver ([5](https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/denver-animal-shelter/about-das/contact.html), [6](https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/denver-city-council/about-us/open-records-policy.html)) and consists of 32,018 entries of violations issued for a 5 year period from 2012-2017. There are 5 variables represented: `zip_code` (zip code of owner cited), `violation_type` (administrative or regular citation), `offense` (official ordinance number), `item_name` (description of violation), `animal_id` (unique animal identifier). Please see the [appendix](#denver-animal-ordinances) for more detailed information on ordinance numbers and descriptions.

Of these 5 variabless the 2 most important for the purpose of this invesigation are `zip_code` and `offense`. A cursory inspection provides the following insights:

+ `zip_code` - The most frequently occuring zip code (80219) appears ~5,500 times in the data, twice as much as the next highest zip code (80239 with ~2,600 occurences). More importantly, there are 429 distinct zip codes present, an issue that will be addressed later on. The mean number of citations per zip code was 815 for this 6 year period, while the median was 460.
+ `offense` - The most frequently occuring offense is __8-16__ (Leash law - 1st offense) with ~8000 occurences, followed by __8-61__ (License required - 1st offense) with ~4,500 occurences. Several of the least issued citations occured less than 10 times in this six year period ( __8-2__: Keeping wild or dangerous animals, __8-3__: Vaccination, __8-82__: Unlawful accumulation of manure, __8-134__: Abandonment, __8-140__: Trapping of animals, __8-131(B)__, and __8-153.5(F)__). Due to 1st, 2nd, 3rd offenses and rescinded and compliant citations there are 58 types of offenses in the original dataset. The mean number of offenses by type is 520, while the median is 34.

It's also worth mentioning that `animal_id` data, though not relevant here, shows that one animal was cited 16 times.

##### Most cited zip codes

Given the fact that this investigation will focus on geographic considerations, I choose to examine the zip code data first. Several points are worth mentioning with respect to the zip code representation shown in this data. First is the the highest and lowest offending zip codes. 

After consulting 3 separate sources ([USPS](https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction!input.action), R's [noncensus package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/noncensus/noncensus.pdf), and R's [choroplethrZip package](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/choroplethrZip/versions/1.5.0)), the 40 common zip codes across sources were found to be the following:

80012 80014 80123 80202 80203 80204 80205 80206 80207 80209 80210 80211 80212 80214 80216 80218 80219 80220 80221 80222 80223 80224 80226 80227 80230 80231 80232 80235 80236 80237 80238 80239 80246 80247 80249 80264 80290 80293 80294

Zip code discrepancies between the three sources were:

80022 80033 80110 80111 80127 80215 80225 80228 80229 80233 80234 80241 80256 80259 80260 80261 80262 80265 80266 80266 80273 80274 80280 80281 80291 80292 80295 80299

Using sources to triangulate true Denver county zip codes ([7](https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/), [8](https://www.denvergov.org/media/gis/WebDocs/Citywide/Neighborhoods.pdf)), I included (or failed to deem unnecessary) the following zip codes from the questionable list: 80110, 80265, 80266, 80292, and 80295. See the [appendix](#final-master-list-obtained-by-crosschecking) for the final master list of zip codes used.

Using this information, the top ten zip codes based on citation frequency are:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# view first 10 entries
# head(zip.sum.vector, 10)
highest <- head(zip.sum.vector, 10)
names(highest) <- c("Zip code", "Number of citations")
# write.csv(highest, "top_10.csv")

# ====== MAPPING TOP 10 TOTAL OFFENDING ZIPS ==========
# region == zip code, value == whatever value for that zip
# top_10_zips <- read.csv("top_10.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", na.strings="") # not using this -- incorrect data
top_10_zips <- highest
# names(top_10_zips)
names(top_10_zips)[1] <- "region"
names(top_10_zips)[2] <- "value"
# names(top_10_zips)
top_10_zips$region <- as.character(top_10_zips$region)
zip_choropleth(top_10_zips,
               county_zoom = denver_fip,
               title = "Top 10 offending zip codes in Denver County",
               legend = "Citations")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
# kable(highest, "html") %>%
  # kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F, position = "float_right")
# knitr::kable(data, caption = "Table with kable")
kable(highest, "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
```

As we can see in the map, the areas of most concern and subsequent proposed outreach are in the western-center part of the county (80219 in particular), and areas near DIA & bordering Adams County (Stapleton, Montbello, & Green Valley Ranch).

##### Least cited zip codes

The lowest offending zip codes are:
  
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# view last 10 entries
# tail(zip.sum.vector, 10)
lowest <- data.frame(tail(zip.sum.vector, 10))
# lowest
# write.csv(lowest, "bottom_10.csv")

# ======== MAPPING BOTTOM 10 OFFENDING ZIPS ==============
# region == zip code, value == whatever value for that zip
# bottom_10_zips <- read.csv("bottom_10.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", na.strings="") # not using this
bottom_10_zips <- lowest
names(bottom_10_zips)[1] <- "region"
names(bottom_10_zips)[2] <- "value"
# names(bottom_10_zips)
bottom_10_zips$region <- as.character(bottom_10_zips$region)
# bottom_10_zips
zip_choropleth(bottom_10_zips,
               county_zoom = denver_fip,
               title = "10 least cited zip codes in Denver County",
               legend = "Citations")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# printing table
names(lowest) <- c("Zip code", "Number of citations")
kable(lowest, "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
```

This map shows an interesting trend: areas on the periphery of the county (bordering Jefferson and Arapahoe Counties) accumulated the least number of citations from 2011-2017, and consequently may be low priority in terms of community outreach. However, it must be noted that the low numbers may in fact be due to other factors (such as less regular patrolling in these areas, for example) over this time period, and not due to the fact that these areas are actually in violation of county ordinances.

##### All zip codes

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# ======== MAPPING All OFFENDING ZIPS ==============
# region == zip code, value == whatever value for that zip
all_zips <- zip.sum.vector
names(all_zips)[1] <- "region"
names(all_zips)[2] <- "value"
# names(all_zips)
all_zips$region <- as.character(all_zips$region)
# all_zips
# mean(all_zips$value) #814.5946
# median(all_zips$value) #461
zip_choropleth(all_zips,
               county_zoom = denver_fip,
               title = "Cited zip codes in Denver County",
               legend = "Citations")

# kable(all_zips, "html") %>%
  # kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
```

The full table of values is available in the [appendix](#all-zip-codes-and-number-of-offenses).

#### Citations by type

In addition to investigating areas by pure citation number alone, it also seems prudent to delve into which ordinances are most problematic in the county generally and where they are most problematic specifically.

While original values can be found in the [appendix](#original-offense-values), data cleaning was employed for the interpretation of this variable. For the sake of simplicity all rescinded ("RSCND") violations or those that came into compliance ("COMP") were removed from the dataset to avoid overcounting, leaving roughly 26,000 observations. Also logically if we are looking to prescribe interventions to curb infractions in the first place these types of citations wouldn't be very helpful. Similarly, all "1st", "2nd", and "3rd" tags were removed, though those entries themselves were kept.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# == cleaning dataset first to account for 1st, 2nd, 3rd ,etc violations ==
# all violations of same type regardless of circumstances will be aggregated
data3 <- data2
# unique(data3$offense) # 58 levels
# typeof(data3$offense) # integer?
# data3$offense
# dim(data3) #30140 x 5

# == remove any compliant or rescinded citations (double counting) ==
data3 <- data3[!grepl("COMP", data3$offense),]
# dim(data3) # 27923 x 5
data3 <- data3[!grepl("RSCND", data3$offense),]
# dim(data3) # 26227 x 5
# data3$offense
# unique(data3$offense)

# == removing 1ST, 2ND, 3RD ==
data3$offense <- sub('\\ .*', '', data3$offense) # using regex to get rid of anything after the space
# unique(data3$offense)
# typeof(data3$offense) # character

# write.csv(data3, "offense_col_cleaned.csv")
data3_cleaned <- read.csv("offense_col_cleaned.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", na.strings="")
data3_cleaned <- data3_cleaned[,-1] # removing extraneous column
# dim(data3_cleaned) #26227 x 6
# names(data3_cleaned)
# summary(data3_cleaned)
# data3_cleaned
```

After sorting the data the top 5 offenses are: 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# == getting frequencies ==
# offense_sum <- data.frame(summary(data3_cleaned$offense))
# offense_sum
# write.csv(offense_sum, "offense_sum.csv")
offense_sum <- read.csv("offense_sum.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", na.strings="")
names(offense_sum) <- c("Offense number", "Frequency")
# offense_sum
offense_sum <- offense_sum[order(-offense_sum$Frequency),] # reverse sort data by frequency
# View(offense_sum)
# kable(head(offense_sum, 5))
kable(head(offense_sum, 5), "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
# top 5 -- 8-16, 8-61, 8-32, 8-70/71, 8-51
```

## Most frequent offenses: 8-16, 8-61, 8-32, 8-70/71, 8-51

#### 8-16 - Leash law

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# summary(data3_cleaned)
leash_law <- data3[which(data3$offense == '8-16'),]
# dim(leash_law) #10358 x 5
# leash_zips <- data.frame(summary(leash_law$zip_code))
# leash_zips
# write.csv(leash_zips, "leash_zips.csv")
leash_zips <- read.csv("leash_zips.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", na.strings="")
names(leash_zips) <- c("Zip code", "Frequency")
# head(leash_zips, 3)
kable(head(leash_zips, 3), "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F, position = "left")
```


#### 8-61 - License required

```{r, echo=FALSE}
license_law <- data3[which(data3$offense == '8-61'),]
# dim(license_law) # 5125 x 5
# license_zips <- data.frame(summary(license_law$zip_code))
# license_zips
# write.csv(license_zips, "license_zips.csv")
license_zips <- read.csv("license_zips.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", na.strings="")
names(license_zips) <- c("Zip code", "Frequency")
# head(leash_zips, 3)
kable(head(license_zips, 3), "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F, position = "left")
```


#### 8-32 - Rabies vaccination required

```{r, echo=FALSE}
rabies_vac <- data3[which(data3$offense == '8-32'),]
# dim(rabies_vac) # 4251 x 5
rabies_zips <- data.frame(summary(rabies_vac$zip_code))
# rabies_zips
write.csv(rabies_zips, "rabies_zips.csv")
rabies_zips <- read.csv("rabies_zips.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", na.strings="")
names(rabies_zips) <- c("Zip code", "Frequency")
kable(head(rabies_zips, 3), "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F, position = "left")
# head(rabies_zips, 3)
```

#### 8-70/71 - Spaying and neutering

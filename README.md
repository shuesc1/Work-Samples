Welcome to my GitHub page! 

This repo shows off code samples from classes I completed at the University of Pennsylvania and also personal projects I am working on.

__Languages/frameworks/tools__: Java (_primary_), Python, C, Flask, Django, Markdown, SciKit-Learn, Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy, Bootstrap, HTML/CSS, Apache FOP, Twitter4J, LaTex


## Highlights

### [596HW7_Maze:](https://github.com/shuesc1/Work-Samples/tree/master/596HW7_Maze)

A project that creates a visual representation (as a maze) of a __minimum-spanning-tree (MST)__ using __Kruskal's algorithm__. This is accomplished via the __path compression__ and __union-by-rank__ heuristics outlined in CLRS. Lastly, the `mazeviewer.java` class allows you to see the maze traversal either by __breadth first search (BFS)__ or __depth-first search (DFS)__. 

### [Bikeshare\_Data\_Analysis:](https://github.com/shuesc1/Work-Samples/tree/master/Bikeshare_Data_Analysis)

I used a __dataset__ from Philadelphia's bicycle sharing program Indego (stored as a __CSV file__). The project parses the data and offers a __user interface__ (`IndegoUserInterface.java`) that provides several statistics given the data (number of trips in a year, longest distance of a trip, the day when usage was highest, etc.).


### [Connect\_to\_care\_app:](https://github.com/shuesc1/Work-Samples/tree/master/Connect_to_care_app)

This is a final project for a data structures and software design. I worked in a group with two other team members to create a web app for [Penn Medicine](https://www.pennmedicine.org/) patients to connect them with behavioral health resources in the network. I chose to focus on front-end development, and consequently relied heavily on __Flask__ (Python microframework), __Bootstrap__, and __HTML/CSS__. Our team worked together to divide the work under a project manager and Penn Medicine liason.

### [PythonPractice:](https://github.com/shuesc1/Work-Samples/tree/master/PythonPractice)

A series of .py files that review general Python syntax as well as exercises of data analysis and manipulation based on Field Cady's textbook _[The Data Science Handbook](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119092949.html)_ using __Python Image Library__, __Pandas__, __SciKit-Learn__, __NumPy__, and __Matplotlib__.

### [RecommendationSystem:](https://github.com/shuesc1/Work-Samples/tree/master/RecommendationSystem)

This project is an implementation of a recommendation system using __Collaborative Filtering (CF)__ with the [MovieLens 10M dataset](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/10m/) in milestone 2 and the [Book-Crossing community dataset](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/%7Ecziegler/BX/) in milestone 3. I completed this project in three steps (milestones) emphasizing code design and extensibility. Consequently, this folder contains several initial __UML diagrams__ I designed for the various classes and processes. Moreover, the algorithm approach to obtaining reasonable recommendations centered around [Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems](http://files.grouplens.org/papers/FnT%20CF%20Recsys%20Survey.pdf), an academic paper by Ekstrand, Riedl, and Konstan. Means of calculating predictions included: __baseline prediction__, user-user CF using __Pearson correlation__ and __cosine similarity__, and __k-nearest neighbors__ calculations.


### [Twitter\_Streaming\_Product\_Tracking:](https://github.com/shuesc1/Work-Samples/tree/master/Twitter_Streaming_Product_Tracking)
 
 My final project for my introduction to programming class. I used __Twitter4J__ and the __Watson API__ to stream tweets from __Twitter__ that mentioned a target product. I then attempted to striate tweets based on target characteristics (location, sentiment, date, etc.).

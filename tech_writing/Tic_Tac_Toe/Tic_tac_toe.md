## Tic-tac-what now? 

+ _Tic-tac-toe is a simple game also known as Xs and Os, or noughts and crosses in different parts of the world. It is a game designed for two players who mark a 3x3 board. Traditionally one player is designated by the mark **X** and the other player is distinguised by the mark **O**. The winner is the player who is able to get three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally._


## Gathering game materials

_The best part of tic-tac-toe is that it is so easy to make a board out of readily available materials. No special game pieces are required!_

What you'll need:

1. A piece of paper to use to make the board.

2.  A writing utensil or two.

That's it!

## Creating the board

_A traditional tic-tac-toe board is a 3x3 grid. Each empty square is an opportunity for a player to claim the space._

Creating a board is as simple as: 

1. Taking your piece of paper and drawing __2 horizontal lines parallel__ to each other. 

2. Then drawing __2 vertical lines parallel__ to each other that __intersect the first two lines__. 

The final product should look like this:

Now you are ready to play!

## Rules & playing the game

#### Basic rules:

1. Player 1 and player 2 take turns.
>**_tip_**: the easiest way to decide who goes first is to [flip a coin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_flipping) and the winner goes first.

2. One player marks their spaces with an __X__ while the other player marks their spaces with an __O__.

3. The first player to get three of their marks in a row -- either __horizontally__, __vertically__,or __diagonally__, is the winner.

4. If players fill the board before either get three marks in a row then a tie is declared.

Some examples of tie situations:

## Playing strategically


### 1. Mark spaces offensively and defensively: 

+ Anticipate the other player's next move and mark _your_ space accordingly; __block possible winning moves__. 
+ Similarly, choose to mark spaces with later options in mind. Mark spaces that set you up for a multiple future choices leading to a win (if possible); __use your turn to mark a space that you know can lead you to a win or at *least* a tie__.

### 2. Choose your _first_ move wisely:

+ The __center square__ and the __top or bottom corner squares__ offer the most in terms of future options -- __*avoid the outer center squares*__.
